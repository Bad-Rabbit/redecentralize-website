    <h1>What's this all about?</h1>
    <p class="lead">
      Over the last few years, we've noticed quite a few people trying to spread
      the Internet out again. Back to the edges, like it used to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes they do it for privacy. Sometimes they do it for resilience against
      disaster. Sometimes they do it just to bring playfulness back to computers
      and how we use them.
    </p>
    <p>
      We've a <a href="https://github.com/rossjones/alternative-internet">list of
      the kind of projects we mean</a> (any missing? send a pull request). On this
      site, we interview one of those projects each month.
