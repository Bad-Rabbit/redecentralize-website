    <h1>What’s redecentralization?</h1>
    <p>
        We’re at the start of a new information revolution.
    </p>

    <p>The last one was the printing press. It <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FCopyright%23History&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFIjgq9c9oH-XvEEIyUhnm7fXUkbw">took centuries</a> 
    for us to work out how to use it fairly. Concepts like copyright, the novel
    and libraries were formed, which we all take for granted now.
    </p>

    <p>Although it seems like lots has happened... personal computers, the
    world wide web, smart phones… Really, it’s only just begun.
    </p>

    <p>The original Internet was decentralized. Anyone could set up parts of
    it. That’s why it won.
    </p>

    <p>For various reasons, control of our information technologies is
    increasingly falling into a few hands. Some big companies and Governments.
    </p>

    <p>We want it to become decentralized. Again.
    </p>

    <h2>Why should anyone care?</h2>

    <p>Motivations vary. These four key themes keep coming up.</p>

    <ol>
      <li><b>Resilience</b> - whether there’s a hurricane, a severed trans-atlantic
      cable or just a train line with a poor connection, we’d like to be able
      to carry on making phone calls and sharing documents.</li>

      <li><b>Privacy</b> - as a company keeping our commercial secrets, or as an
      individual concerned about our government overstepping the line, we'd
      like our most personal messages not to be held in distant data
      centres.</li>

      <li><b>Competition</b> - instead of being buyers forced to buy books from one
      store, or sellers forced to use one payment processor, we'd like
      democratic digital marketplaces and currencies.</li>

      <li><b>Fun</b> - innovation on the network is slowing down, and increasingly
      either superficial or limited to large companies. Instead, we'd like our
      community to form new protocols so that creative new services can be
      built.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>What’s Redecentralize.org going to do?</h2>

    <p>Our goal is to get decentralized products into the hands of billions.
    </p>

    <p>We help build the communities and networks needed to make that happen. 
    </p>

    <p>
    We’re not going to build technology or products ourselves.
    </p>

    <p>
    We will do things like &hellip;
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>help market the concepts, the people, the products</li>
      <li>build a shared language for decentralization</li>
      <li>host events and online communities</li>
      <li>speak about the movement in the media</li>
      <li>research what business models will work</li>
      <li>attract financiers whether VCs, Government or the crowd</li>
    </ul>

    &hellip; whatever it takes. To reach billions.
