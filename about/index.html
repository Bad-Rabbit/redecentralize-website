    <h1>What's this all about?</h1>
    <p class="lead">
      Over the last few years, we've noticed quite a few people trying to spread
      the Internet out again. Back to the edges, like it used to be.
    </p>

      Sometimes they do it for privacy. Sometimes they do it for resilience against
      disaster. Sometimes they do it just to bring playfulness back to computers
      and how we use them.

      We've a <a href="https://github.com/redecentralize/alternative-internet" target="_blank">list of
      the kind of projects we mean</a> (any missing? send a pull request). On this
      site, we interview one of those projects each month.
