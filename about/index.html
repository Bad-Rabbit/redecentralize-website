    <h2>What's this all about?</h2>

    <p>Over the last few years, we've noticed quite a few people trying to spread the Internet
    out again. Back to the edges, like it used to be.</p>

    <p>Sometimes they do it for privacy. Sometimes they do it for resilience against
    disaster. Sometimes they do it just to bring playfulness back to computers and
    how we use them.</p>

    <p>We've a <a href="https://github.com/rossjones/alternative-internet">list of the kind of projects we mean</a>
    (any missing? send a pull request). On this site, we interview one
    of those projects each month.
